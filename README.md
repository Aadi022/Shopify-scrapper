# Shopify-scrapper
# Project Name

## Backend
The backend is scripted in NodeJS. The following libraries and tools were utilized:

- **Axios**: To fetch the web pages.
- **Cheerio**: For scraping those web pages. The scraping process was successful and performed perfectly till the last `<loc>` link. 

However, I encountered an issue when passing the scraped content to the OpenAI LLM API. The content was deemed unsuitable for the API to process.

## Frontend
The frontend was developed using ReactJS, with styling done using CSS. Although the API isn't fully operational, I included API calls to demonstrate the process. I created empty cards to showcase the frontend design and implemented slight animations on hover for visual enhancement.
